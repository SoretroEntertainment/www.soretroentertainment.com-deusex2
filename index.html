	<br>Let me do a little recap on the first game. 
Deus Ex is not just any first person arena shooter from the 90s, 
although it was released in 2000, it is far away from a simple fun spray 'n pray shooter. 
Deus Ex is considered to be a pinnacle of immersive simulators by the mass, 
for all the good reasons that have been acknowledged, and also because Deus Ex, 
is the reality. I'm being for real, its story is that fucking good. In real life, 
people are still having discussions about the current state of the world, 
they discuss economy, politics, corruption, inflation, crimes, tax rates, and... 
the list is huge, and that's what Deus Ex is about. It's not just 100% relevant, 
the writers of this game definitely wanted to express their concern on global 
issues through a videogame but also share the other views to avoid misinformation 
and blatant propaganda, and they did their best, that's right, they did their BEST. 
No any other videogame that at least involves a military conflict could've reached the 
level of political awareness. Suck it, Activision. If you haven't figured it out yet, 
please, play the first Deus Ex game, it's ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY, otherwise you won't 
understand how do you live, I made that mistake 4 years ago and I regret it ever since.
<p>
<br>
This is as far as I could tell you, I won't share any more spoilers than this. 
If anything, the gameplay is shitload of fun and if some piece of shit would 
think the opposite, they can go fuck themselves if they hate joy. Speaking of 
anti-fun, I was playing Deus Ex 2 for a couple of hours, but I couldn't bother to 
beat the game because... I don't even know how do I start this. First and foremost, 
I feel sincerely sorry for Ion Storm, not. Just... Okay. Why is this game real? 
Why does it exist? Because I want to know what fucking imbecile would think of 
implementing this franchise to a console. I don't care if Deus Ex for the PS2 
was a success or not. I've never interpreted Deus Ex as a videogame exclusively 
for consoles, or at least a game that could be consolified, in fact it should've been the 
last fucking game to be released for the consoles. And just adding salt to a wound, 
developer company (or their publisher Eidos Montreal) decided to modify Unreal 
Engine, for some reason. And guess what? Their job of game engine modification, 
was their decision by far and it's what made the game unplayable in every way imaginable.
</p>
<p>
<br>
I really tried playing this, I did. But I got easily bored everytime I had to load a 
fucking savefile and it takes forever to load so. That's also because it's something 
to do with unused textures, or whatever the fuck it is for the game to be this unoptimized 
than it doesn't need to be, even for a modified game engine. If the loading 
screen takes this long, I bet the framerate is agonizing on Xbox. Oh, it is? 
Well that's a complete waste of investment alright. Matter of fact, the whole game is a waste of 
investment. Potentials, talent, good aspects, fucking everything that was in the first Deus Ex title, 
all evaporated in its sequel, so much so that there's nothing worthy of checking it out. 
</p>
<p>
<br>
To tell you how fucking terrible this game is, take a good look at Deus Ex's environment.
<br><img srcset="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SoretroEntertainment/www.soretroentertainment.com-deusex2/4090612fd631ed26280077068fa2ba952de50c04/DX1EnvComparison.png" alt="Deus Ex Env Comparison" width="700" height="256">
</p>
<p>
<br>
And now Deus Ex 2's.
<br><img srcset="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SoretroEntertainment/www.soretroentertainment.com-deusex2/4090612fd631ed26280077068fa2ba952de50c04/DX2EnvComparison.png" alt="Deus Ex 2 Env Comparison" width="700" height="256">
</p>
<p>
<br>
Ion Storm weren't fucking around when it comes to the aesthetics. They paid the attention to 
almost every detail, so not only the developers knew you'd consider going this way, they
knew each location and spent their best efforts on capturing the atmosphere, this choice 
wishes the player to integrate into the unknown, certainly undesirable world that wants
you to explore the whole of it. Deus Ex 2's environment, does not bring the same feeling. 
I mean look at this fucking garbage, does it really look nice when it's all so... boring? 
Really it's one of the main reasons why I couldn't continue my playthrough, it feels so 
generic and shallow and dull and outright boring, I feel like I'm losing all my motivation 
when I look at the graphics. I don't know about you but it gives the impression that 
Ion Storm could care less about the design as much as for all the game aspects, leaving me 
(or anyone who had played this) completely uninterested.
</p>
<p>
<br>
Oh yeah, speaking of the visuals, they're HORRIBLE. I want to fucking vomit everytime 
I pay attention to it. If there is a game that needs one of them Fallout 3 ENB mods, it's 
this piece of shit. I can't believe this was passed by testers (as if they had them). 
Well thankfully I'm not a graphics whore or anything like that, it could've been easily fixed by 
testing their game properly, think long and hard on how unironically ugly the graphics are. 
I guess they didn't so let's talk about the gameplay.
</p>
<p>
<br>
One of Deus Ex's features as an immersive simulator is conversating with the NPCs, 
every chance you get to talk to a local, you're gathering new information, or it's 
to be aware of their thoughts. Deus Ex 2 also has that, but the way voice acting was 
done... No, you don't feel like you're talking to a person, you're talking to a fucking 
robot. Alex D, the protagonist, also acts like a robot and is not even able to 
express their emotions by voice. Just what the fuck is this? The protagonist of the first 
Deus Ex game wasn't sentimental but at least he felt like a human being, and so 
did every character in the game. There might be an excuse for Alex to be a soulless 
doll from being used an experimental rat, is or was owned by a corporation, putting 
themselves into a literal fucking errand boy/girl for everybody, particularly who's 
in charge, but a lot of NPCs act and sound like robots or humanoids, they're far 
below your class and they're less intelligent than your playable character. How 
could they fuck up voice acting as well? Did they know just how shit the game was?
</p>
<p>
<br>
Yeah apparently it is really awful if the gunplay is unbearable. First off, 
why would someone in their mind, replace ammo with universal ammo? FUCKING WHY? 
This does not compute with Deus Ex in any way. Can this get any worse? And not 
only that but it makes the combat less fun than it is enough. Every weapon in the 
game shares their ammo, even a railgun, even a fucking rocket launcher. The fuck 
you mean a rocket launcher uses battery cells? Shouldn't the whole world PACK with 
heavy weapons if that's the fucking case? The combat is pure unsatisfactory, you 
blast towards an enemy face to face and you don't feel the sudden shock you're 
expecting from a shotgun, any gun doesn't bring you any sort of punch because 
even powerful weapons like Sniper Rifle only will make you ask yourself a question, 
"Are the firearms even firearms?". And don't get me started with non lethal 
playthrough, in the first Deus Ex it was an option for an agent (you) to proceed 
with discretion, but don't bother with Deus Ex 2, it's impossible to keep up your 
playthrough knowing just how atrocious the game really is. It's so 
atrocious when, for example, a shotgun can miss point blank. 
Point fucking blank.
</p>
<p>
<br>
It's bad enough the combat system is abysmal, I have not mentioned anything of 
gameplay. Let me ask you this, can it be CONSIDERED gameplay? With fuck ups 
like this, what can go wrong? It's much less interactive, you can't even use a 
fucking terminal, you can't enter codes in numpad locks, you can only HACK them 
and it just gives you money. Just money? It's not possible to access through 
security system unless you have a code, you can only use a numpad lock if you 
have a code for it? Why... why in the FUCKING WOLRD WAS THAT A GOOD IDEA? I 
don't fucking care if the protagonist doesn't know, this is an immersive 
simulator for christ sake, you're SUPPOSED to have full freedom over your 
protagonist. And when the game already gives you a handful of weapons and 
augmentation canisters... well it's a clear sign that this game is gonna be 
very short, thank god for that, huh? If it was really really short I would've 
finished it, I didn't. I get the feeling it'll be too fucking long.
</p>
<p>
<br>
Alright, alright, I get it. You hate this game, you resent it to death but 
guess what? So does everybody. Everyone knows it's a pile of shit, so why bother? 
I think I may have not told you this, but I give videogames a chance. Whether it's 
considered to be an awful game or a good game. If I say that this piece of shit 
sucks, it sucks. If I say this piece of shit might be good, it might be. And if 
I say, that this piece of shit is not actually a piece of shit, it's not. I 
haven't discovered any more examples other than Blood 2 and of course this 
particular game. I gave it a chance, you see now? I'm very much 
disappointed at anyone, and I mean anyone, who was willing to work on this 
project, Ion Storm did not mind the fact that their game would be a total 
fucking failure if it could just work properly, it wouldn't matter unless 
the game isn't even fun to play, so it fucking blows in any way.
</p>
<p>
<br>
The only reason I considered playing it is obvious: I finished Deus Ex, 
I loved the story to death, I wanted to play the sequel... only to be 
left with sorrow and regret. Did I play it for the story? If that's the 
only thing it kept me playing, then absolutely. I wanted to know ‎ ‎ ‎  
ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎  ‎  ‎ ‎  ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎  
I wanted to know what happened to old faces and what's gonna happen 
to new faces. The story is so fucking good that it made me play this trash, 
but since this is the Internet age, I'n able to watch someone's full walkthrough 
on YouTube anytime I desire because this game does not bring me the joy, 
I don't think the cheats would help somehow.
</p>
<p>
<br>
And let's say that there may be improvements, learned from mistakes of the first game 
(I can't even tell which), surprisingly they've designed ragdoll physics, 
you could toss the body anywhere you'd feel to. Does it make this game any 
more bearable? The obvious answer is no. You were expecting for me to put 
an additional information to this? Again, no. This shit is not worth it, 
this game was not worth it. Just a huge waste of fucking time. And you 
know what else? Reviewing this game is a waste of time as well, it costed 
me time and wasted my potentials. Let's pretend that it never came out of 
the light, that the developers thought first instead of making moves, now 
if you excuse me, I'm going to buy Super Nintendo along with the cartridge, 
containing Super Metroid. Why? Because even if that is a waste of money, 
I'd rather not bore myself to death.
</p>
<p>
<br>
But... I'm not gonna end on this note. You see, I've come across 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TozSf50GXq8">a particular 
video on YouTube</a>, it's... an easter egg. First off, there was no way this 
piece of shit would have an easter egg. Second, I thought it was a fucking 
joke or something, like some deranged asshole with a level editor (if it was a real thing) 
had just made this as an April Fools joke. It wasn't uploaded on the first of 
the month and from what I've analysed, it's definitely fucking real. It's not 
just an easter egg but a showcase of developers' quotes during the development. 
It's mainly just the most outrageous shit they've said, but I want to focus on what 
I've just discovered. "Monte: Gosh dang this f*cking frame rate" ...So, if they 
knew about the game issues, they were still willing to publish the game? They 
knew the PROBLEM THE WHOLE FUCKING TIME AND THEY DIDN'T BOTHER FIXING IT?
</p>
<p>
<br>
You know what? I was about to write an another monologue about how much this game, 
fucking sucks. But I'm tired of repeating myself, in this case I'll just throw the 
fewest words any sane human being would've said by now: Fuck you all.
